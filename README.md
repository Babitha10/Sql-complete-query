# Sql-complete-query
#The objective of this project is to practice and demonstrate the use of basic SELECT queries in SQL to retrieve data from a database. This includes using SELECT statements with clauses such as WHERE, AND, OR, LIKE, BETWEEN, ORDER BY, and LIMIT. The goal is to build a strong foundation in SQL data retrieval techniques using tools like MySQL Workbench
